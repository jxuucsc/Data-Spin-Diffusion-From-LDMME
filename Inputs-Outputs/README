In each subfolders,
"work_phonon" subfolder contains files for phonon calculations
"Wannier" subfolder contains files for Wannierization
"ld-dmd" subfolder contains files for spin lifetimes and diffusions lengths



#======================================================================
# Steps of calculations of spin lifetimes and diffusion lengths
#======================================================================
1.
DFT calculation by JDFTx. See script jdftx.sh

2.
phonon calculation by JDFTx in folder "work_phonon"

3.
Wannierization calculation by JDFTx in folder Wannier

4.
Initialization calculation by modified FeynWann code in folder "ld-dmd".
See for example, folder "ld-dmd\hole_t300\mult16" and scipt jdftx-ld-init.sh.
A soft link called "Wannier", linking to the folder containing Wannier files, is needed

5.
Calculations of spin lifetimes and diffusion lengths by python3 scripts in folder "Python-Scripts".
See for example, folder "ld-dmd/hole_t300/mult16/ldmme".
In step 4, a folder called "ldbd_data" is created,
then in this step, A soft link of this "ldbd_data" folder is necessary
