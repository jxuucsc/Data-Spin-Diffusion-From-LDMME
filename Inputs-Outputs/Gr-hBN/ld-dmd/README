mu0.1 means Fermi level is set to 0.1 eV above the middle of band gap of Gr-hBN

# Note about results of lifetime and diffusion lengths
#======================================================================
Final results of lifetime and diffusion lengths are obtained from
exponential-cosine fits of spin observable evolution curves S(x,t).

For example, for spin diffusion length,
in file "solve_tl_fromldmme_ldbdfiles_grbn.out",
search "Sxx_sxpert (exp cos)", you can find "tau =  30.94255049098883 micro-meter",
this means that spin diffusion length along x of Sx is about 30.9 micro-meter.

Similarly, search "Syx_sypert (exp cos)" and "Szx_szpert (exp cos)" in file "solve_tl_fromldmme_ldbdfiles_grbn.out",
you can find spin diffusion length along x of Sy and Sz.
