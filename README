1.
Folder "Data-For-Plots-of-Main-Text" contains
final data used for ploting the figures of the main text.


2.
Folder "Inputs-Ouputs" contains
input files of the calculations used for generating data of the main-text figures
and the key output files of representative calcuations.


3.
Folder "Python-Scripts" constains
python3 scripts used for computing spin lifetimes and spin diffusion lengths
using data of physical quantities generated by FeynWann package (interfaced to open-source JDFTx package)

FeynWann package is written by Ravishankar Sundararaman (sundar@rpi.edu)
and modified by the author Junqing Xu (jqxu@hfut.edu.cn) for spin dynamics.

For different materials, run different "solve_tl_fromldmme_ldbdfiles_XXX.py" files.
"XXX" depends on the material, e.g., "XXX" is "gaas" for cubic GaAs.
